# Better OneTab **RELOADED**

**(Based on the archived [Better OneTab](https://github.com/cnwangjie/better-onetab) by cnwangjie)**

This project is a continuation and maintenance effort for the excellent [Better OneTab extension](https://github.com/cnwangjie/better-onetab) which has been archived by its original author, cnwangjie. My goal is to keep the project updated and address bugs, as I use the extension... extensively myself.
